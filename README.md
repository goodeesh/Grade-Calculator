# Grade-Calculator

The Grade Calculator is a simple console application that helps you calculate your grade based on your test and exercise scores. You can enter your test scores for midterms and finals and your exercise scores to get the total points and percentage, as well as the final grade you'll receive for the class.

To use the application, simply run the program in your console and follow the prompts. Enter the type of score (midterm, final, or exercise) and then enter the score itself. The program will automatically calculate your total points and percentage as you enter your scores, and it will display your final grade once you enter an equals sign (=) as the type of score.

The program has some validation built in to prevent you from entering scores that are out of range. For example, midterm and final scores must be between 0 and 70, while exercise scores must be between 0 and 0.50. If you try to enter a score that is outside of these ranges, the program will display an error message and ask you to enter a valid score.

Once you're finished entering your scores, the program will display your total points and percentage, as well as your final grade. If your total points and percentage are both 0, then your final grade will be 0. If your total points and percentage are above a certain threshold (55%), then your exercise scores will be factored into your final grade. Otherwise, your exercise scores will not be counted.

Overall, the Grade Calculator is a simple and straightforward tool that can be useful for students who want to calculate their grade quickly and easily.
